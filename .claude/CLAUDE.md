# Project Guidelines

### Before Implementation
- Develop a comprehensive specification document

## Code Quality Standards

### Type Safety
- Follow explicit type rules strictly
- Avoid using `any` type unless absolutely necessary
- Prefer interfaces over type aliases for object shapes
- Use strict TypeScript configuration

### Test Coverage Requirements
- Maintain minimum 90% line coverage
- Maintain minimum 95% branch coverage
- Write comprehensive unit tests for all functions
- Include edge cases and error scenarios in tests

### Code Principles
- Index on simplicity - prefer clear, readable code over clever solutions
- Write idiomatic code that follows language and framework conventions
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use descriptive variable and function names

### Development Process
- Always create comprehensive specification documents before implementation
- Define clear interfaces and contracts before coding
- Document expected behavior, edge cases, and error handling
- Review specifications with stakeholders before proceeding

## Implementation Workflow
1. Analyze requirements thoroughly
2. Create detailed specification document
3. Define interfaces and data structures
4. Implement with focus on simplicity and clarity
5. Write comprehensive tests to meet coverage requirements
6. Refactor for idiomatic patterns while maintaining simplicity
