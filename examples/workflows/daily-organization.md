# Daily Organization Workflow

A comprehensive daily file organization routine using Polish to maintain a clean, organized digital workspace.

## Overview

This workflow processes files throughout the day, ensuring nothing accumulates in temporary locations like Downloads, Desktop, or email attachments.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Files not being processed:**
```bash

polish analyze ~/Desktop --verbose

# Check supported file types
polish list-supported
```

**Too many files processed:**
```bash
# Use more specific filters
polish organize ~/Downloads --types "pdf,docx" --newer-than 1d
```

**Duplicate files:**
```bash
# Check for duplicates before organizing
polish analyze ~/Downloads --check-duplicates
```

## Benefits

1. **Clean Workspace**: Never accumulate files in temporary locations
2. **Consistent Organization**: All files follow the same organizational logic
3. **Automated Tagging**: Files are automatically tagged for easy retrieval
4. **Time Savings**: Automated processing saves manual organization time
5. **Searchable Archive**: Everything is searchable in your Obsidian vault

## Customization

### Adjust for Your Workflow

```bash
# Modify processing frequency
polish organize --schedule "every 2 hours"

# Change organization style
polish config set organizationStyle "date-based"

# Add custom tag patterns
polish config set customTagPatterns.priority "urgent|high|medium|low"
```

### Create Shortcuts

```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
alias daily-cleanup='polish profile switch daily && polish organize'
alias quick-desktop='polish organize ~/Desktop --quiet'
alias downloads-check='polish analyze ~/Downloads --summary'
```

This daily workflow ensures your digital workspace stays organized with minimal manual intervention!
